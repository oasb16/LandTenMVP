# 🧩 LandTen MVP Playbook — The Scroll-by-Scroll Puzzle Manual

Welcome, Architect–Developer–Integrator–Tester. This is your complete guide to building and unifying the LandTen MVP system.

Each superstructure (SS1–SS10) is treated as a symbolic **Scroll Node** with a one-word protocol. Follow this manual chapter-by-chapter to develop, integrate, and test the LandTen Hyperstructure.

## 🔱 Chapter Layout

Each chapter = one scroll node = one superstructure

## ✅ Integration Flow Architecture

[Gate] → [Pulse]
           ↓
        [Echo] → [Root]
           ↓
        [View] → [Cast] → [Bind] → [Sync] → [Seal] → [Core]

Each scroll node is independently verifiable and integratable.
