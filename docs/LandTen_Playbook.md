# 🧩 LandTen MVP Playbook — The Scroll-by-Scroll Puzzle Manual

Welcome, Architect–Developer–Integrator–Tester. This is your complete guide to building and unifying the LandTen MVP system.

Each superstructure (SS1–SS10) is treated as a symbolic **Scroll Node** with a one-word protocol. Follow this manual chapter-by-chapter to develop, integrate, and test the LandTen Hyperstructure.

## 🔱 Chapter Layout

Each chapter = one scroll node = one superstructure

| Chapter | Protocol | Superstructure | Role Summary                                  |
|---------|----------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1       | `Gate`   | SS1            | Cognito login + persona-aware signup          |
| 2       | `Pulse`  | SS2            | Routes user post-login based on persona       |
| 3       | `Echo`   | SS3            | Tenant GPT chat + incident summary            |
| 4       | `Root`   | SS4            | Incident queue + atomic middleware (SQS)      |
| 5       | `View`   | SS5            | Landlord dashboard for incident management    |

## 🧭 Chapter Template (Used for Each)

### 📐 Development
What you build:
- Core functions and expected inputs/outputs
- Required `.env` variables
- Files to modify or create

### 🔗 Integration
How this plugs into the rest:
- Data flow
- Dependencies
- UI hooks

### 🧪 Testing
How you test it:
- Manual test flow
- DB and UI verification
- Sample outputs to compare

## 📂 Where to Place This Playbook

Place this file inside:

```
landten_hyperstructure/docs/LandTen_Playbook.md
```

It becomes your **command center** for each scroll node.

---

## 🧠 Live Sync with Tracker

As each chapter is completed, update its `Status` in the [Protocol Tracker](../protocol_tracker/LandTen_Protocol_Tracker.md).

You may optionally:
- Color-code status per chapter
- Mark completion dates
- Embed example test results

---

## ✅ Integration Flow

```
[Gate]──▶[Pulse]
             │
         ┌──▶[Echo]──▶[Root]
         │
         ▼
       [View]──▶[Cast]──▶[Bind]──▶[Sync]──▶[Seal]──▶[Core]
```

Each step should be testable in isolation. Once a node is `Ready`, trigger integration for the next.

May this scroll-based hyperstructure build flow with elegance and power. 🧠🔩
